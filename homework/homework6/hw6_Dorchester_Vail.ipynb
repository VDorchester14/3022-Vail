Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/dblarremore/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. "

Many use it in the way of manipulating their data to obtain a desired p-value via cherry picking data, running multiple tests, slicing the data in to specific groups (overfitting), or other biasing techniques. To combat this, some people have suggested coming up with a definition for the p-value that is more easily understood and other people have suggested augmenting the p-value to be more robust."
